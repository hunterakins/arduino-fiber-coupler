Photodiode amplifier circuit does not work. 
The output is a nearly constant 3.66 volts regardless of whether or not light is hitting the photodiode.
I think I will remove the photodiode from the circuit and see what the output is.
Possible problems:
I need to trim the first op amp with a pot
I put the resistors in the wrong places
Photodiode is fried...
